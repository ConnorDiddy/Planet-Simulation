# Planet-Simulation
This is a simulation of the planets in our solar system built in Pygame.

Run the main.py file to see a realistic simulation of the orbits of Mercury, Benus, Earth, and Mars around the Sun!

NOTE: I am not the original author for all of this code. I followed along a coding tutorial for the bulk of the code, and then made some changes and additions of my own!
